# Team Participatory System Dynamics or "Team PSD"

## Team PSD is using R and rMarkdown to format our participatory system dynamics facilitation resources. 

## Posting our work on GitHub enables transparency, reproducibility and team collaboration. 

## Our first team issue is developing our style sheets for formatting consistency when using rMarkdown.
