# Team PSD
## Team PSD is using R and rMarkdown to format our participatory system dynamics facilitation resources.

## We are using GitHub to make our work transparent, accessible and reproducible.
This workflow also helps with iterating through our prototypes and collaborating across our team.

# This style branch is where we are building a variety of style files that we use in our team.
## This includes the Veterans Health Administration Graphics and Style requirements for fonts and brand colors.
## It also includes rMarkdown style files for peer-reviewed scientific manuscripts.  
## We are starting with APA Style.
