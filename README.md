**Team PSD is using R and rMarkdown to format our participatory system dynamics facilitation resources.**

We are also using the RQDA package and the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Reserach to code our PSD Development Process.

Posting our work on GitHub enables transparency, reproducibility and team collaboration.

Our first team issue is developing our style sheets for formatting consistency when using rMarkdown. We are still working on that...

But, our facilitation_guide branch now has 4 learning loop exercises adapted from https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Scriptapedia

* Building Shared Vision
* Graphs Over Time
* Eliciting Causal Loop Diagrams
* Ratio Exercise
